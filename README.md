# SitePy
About SitePy:

This is a Python program that I am creating for my final project in my "Python Programming for GIS" class, held during the Fall 2016 semester. The purpose of this program is to help me to quickly and efficiently import archaeological site data from an online database, and pull out specific data for analysis.

The downloaded data for this project comes from the Georgia Archaeological Site File (GASF), and is available for free download through opencontext.org. The GASF describes themselves as being "the official repository for Georgiaâ€™s archaeological site information", and maintains detailed records of all archaeological sites throughout the state of Georgia.
