# SitePy

## Project Objective
SitePy is a Python program that I am creating for my final project in my "Python Programming for GIS" class. The purpose of this program is to help me to quickly and efficiently import archaeological site data from an online database, and pull out specific data for analysis.

## Data
The downloaded data for this project comes from the Georgia Archaeological Site File (GASF), and is available for free download through [opencontext.org](https://opencontext.org/). The GASF is based at the University of Georgia's [Laboratory of Archaeology](https://archaeology.uga.edu/archlab/), and it was founded in 1976. The GASF is "the official repository for Georgiaâ€™s archaeological site information", and maintains detailed records of all archaeological sites throughout the state of Georgia.

## Program Details

I will continue to update this section with updates about the SitePy program.
